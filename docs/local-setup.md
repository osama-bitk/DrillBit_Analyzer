# Set Up the Project Locally

```bash
# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/SkalskiP/make-sense.git

# navigate to main dir
cd Drill_Bit_Analyzer

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
npm start
```
To ensure proper functionality of the application locally, npm `6.x.x` and node.js `v11.x.x` versions are required. More information about this problem is available in the [#16].
